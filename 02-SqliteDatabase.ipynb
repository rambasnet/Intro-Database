    "\n",
    "- https://sqlite.org/index.html\n",
    "- SQLite is a software library that provides a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, and transactional SQL database engine\n",
    "- simpler terms: it's a lightweight, file-based relational database management system that allows you to create, manage, and interact with databases using the SQL language\n",
    "- commonly used in scenarios where a full-fledged database server might be overkill or unnecessary, such as small to medium-sized applications, mobile apps, embedded systems, and prototyping\n",
    "- particularly well-suited for projects that need a simple and self-contained database solution without the need for a dedicated database server"

    "## Key Features of Sqlite DB\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-Contained\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQLite operates as a library linked directly into the application\n",
    "- database engine and the application using it are tightly integrated into a single program\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serverless\n",
    "\n",
    "- no separate server process, no need to set up and maintain a database server\n",
    "- suitable for embedded systems, mobile applications, and desktop applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero-Configuration\n",
    "- doesn't require complex configuration or administration\n",
    "- simply include the SQLite library in your application and start using it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transactional\n",
    "- supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure data integrity and reliability even in the face of system failures or crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File-Based\n",
    "- database is stored in a single file on the disk\n",
    "- makes it easy to manage, backup, and transfer databases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Platform\n",
    "- SQLite is designed to work on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supports Standard SQL\n",
    "- SQLite uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data, making it familiar to those who are already accustomed to relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limited Concurrent Access\n",
    "- supports concurrent read access by multiple processes or threads\n",
    "- doesn't support concurrent write \n",
    "- not recommended for situations with heavy write loads and high-concurrency requirements\n",

    "- CREATE TABLE statement is used to define and create a new table within a database\n",
    "- a table is a structured collection of data organized into rows and columns, where each column has a specific data type and each row represents a record\n",

    "\n",
    "- tables are the primary data storage units\n",
    "- each table is characterized by its name, columns, data types, and constraints\n",
    "- columns (also called attributes or fields) are data/values stored in each record\n",
    "- tables need to be created before data can be stored into it\n",
    "\n",
    "## Column Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "- each table definition specifies the columns (also known as fields or attributes)\n",
    "- column definitions include the column name, data type, and any constraints\n",
    "- most Relational DB Engines use static/rigid data types for columns\n",
    "- SQLite DB uses flexible dynamic typing and it's a feature not bug\n",
    "- SQLite provides STRICT Table for static/rigid typing enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQLite Storage Classes & Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html\n",
    "- each value stored in an SQLite database (or manipulated by the database engine) has one of the following storage classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Storage | Datatype |\n",
    "| ----- | ----------|\n",
    "| NULL | NULL value |\n",
    "| INTEGER | signed integer in 0...8 bytes depending on the magnitude |\n",
    "| REAL | floating point value 8-byte |\n",
    "| TEXT | text string (utf-8 and other encodings)\n",
    "| BLOB | blob of data, stored exactly as it as input |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Date and Time Datatype\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times\n",
    "- usually dates and times are stored as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER\n",
    "- use SQLite provided functions or language features to convert data to date and time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table constraints\n",
    "- PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "- a primary key is a unique identifier for a record within a relational database table\n",
    "- is used to uniquely identify each row or record in a table\n",
    "- the primary key ensures that there are no duplicate values within the column(s) designated as the primary key\n",
    "- primary keys help to maintain data integrity and provide a reliable and efficient way to access and manage data\n",
    "- primary key is used to establish relationship among the tables\n",
    "- CustomerID column in the table above is the primary key\n",
    "- can use separate line with PRIMARY KEY constraint to identify PK column(s), especially if there are more than 1 primary key column\n",
    "\n",
    "- e.g.: \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employee (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INTEGER NOT NULL,\n",
    "    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",

    "```\n",
    "- can also use a list of multiple columns as PRIMARY KEY(column_1, column_2,...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key characteristics of Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uniquness\n",
    " - a primary key must contain unique values for each record in the table\n",
    "- No two records can have the same primary key value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Null\n",
    "- values in a primary key column cannot be null (empty) because null values are not unique\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single or Composite\n",
    "- can consist of a single column or multiple columns, depending on the requirements of the database design\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Integrity\n",
    "- by enforcing uniqueness and non-null constraints, the primary key ensures that each record is uniquely identifiable, preventing data duplication and inconsistency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access and Referencing\n",
    "- primary keys are used to uniquely identify records within the table\n",
    "- they also serve as a basis for establishing relationships between tables using foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatically Generated Primary Keys\n",
    "- in some cases, primary key values are automatically generated by the DBMS when new records are added\n",
    "- this is often seen with auto-incrementing integer values\n"

    "## FOREIGN KEY\n",
    "\n",
    "- FK is a field or a set of fields that refers to the primary key of another table\n",
    "- it establishes a relationship between two tables, enabling you to maintain referential integrity and ensure data consistency across related tables\n",
    "- in essence, a foreign key creates a link between records in two tables, enforcing rules about the relationships between those records\n",
    "- the table containing the foreign key is referred to as the \"child\" table, and the table to which the foreign key refers is referred to as the \"parent\" table\n",
    "- the foreign key column(s) in the child table hold values that match the primary key values in the parent table\n",
    "- when inserting record into child table, there must be an existing record in the parent table\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of using foreign keys include\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Referential Integrity\n",
    "- Foreign keys help maintain the integrity of the relationships between tables, preventing orphaned or inconsistent data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Consistency\n",
    "- they ensure that only valid values are inserted into the foreign key column, reducing the risk of data anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relationship Definition\n",
    "- Foreign keys explicitly define the relationships between tables, making it easier to understand the database's structure\n",
    "- help reduce data redundancy making tables smaller storing unique information on some entity\n",

    "- rules that are defined on a column or a set of columns to enforce referential integrity between related tables when related records in parent table are updated or deleted \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common types of foreign key constraints/actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CASCADE**: \n",
    "- when a record in the parent table is deleted or updated, the corresponding records in the child table are also deleted or updated automatically\n",
    "- this helps maintain data consistency across related tables\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_columns)\n",
    "   REFERENCES parent_table(parent_key_columns)\n",
    "      ON DELETE CASCADE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SET NULL**:\n",
    "- when a record in the parent table is deleted or updated, the foreign key values in the child table are set to `NULL`\n",
    "- this is useful when you want to allow records to exist in the child table even if the related record in the parent table is deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_columns)\n",
    "   REFERENCES parent_table(parent_key_columns)\n",
    "      ON DELETE SET NULL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SET DEFAULT**: \n",
    "- similar to `SET NULL`, but the foreign key values in the child table are set to their default values defined when the table was created\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_columns)\n",
    "   REFERENCES parent_table(parent_key_columns)\n",
    "      ON DELETE SET DEFAULT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **NO ACTION**:\n",
    "- prevents any actions that would violate referential integrity, such as deleting a record from the parent table if related records exist in the child table\n",
    "- this constraint essentially stops actions that would create inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_columns)\n",
    "   REFERENCES parent_table(parent_key_columns)\n",
    "      ON DELETE CASCADE\n",
    "      ON UPDATE NO ACTION\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **RESTRICT**: \n",
    "- similar to `NO ACTION`, it prevents actions that would violate referential integrity\n",
    "- tt's a more restrictive version of the constraint and is often used interchangeably with `NO ACTION`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **CHECK**:\n",
    "- CHECK constraints allow you to define additional data integrity checks beyond UNIQUE or NOT NULL to suit your specific application\n",
    "- allows you to define a boolean expressions to test values whenever they are inserted into or updated within a column\n",
    "- if the values do not meet the criteria defined by the expression, SQLite will issue a constraint violation and abort the statement\n",
    "- SQLite allows you to define a CHECK constraint at the column level or the table level\n",
    "- syntax of CHECK constraint at the column level:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name(\n",
    "    ...,\n",
    "    column_name data_type CHECK(expression),\n",

    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",

    "## Table Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "- tables are the primary data storage units\n",
    "- each table is characterized by its name, columns, data types, and constraints.\n",
    "- columns (also called attributes or fields) are data/values stored in each record\n",
    "- tables need to be created before data can be stored into it\n",
    "\n",

    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary keys\n",
    "- a primary key is a unique identifier for a record within a relational database table\n",
    "- is used to uniquely identify each row or record in a table\n",
    "- the primary key ensures that there are no duplicate values within the column(s) designated as the primary key\n",
    "- primary keys help to maintain data integrity and provide a reliable and efficient way to access and manage data\n",
    "- primary key is used to establish relationship among the tables\n",
    "- CustomerID column in the table above is the primary key\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key characteristics of Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uniquness\n",
    " - a primary key must contain unique values for each record in the table\n",
    "- No two records can have the same primary key value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Null\n",
    "- values in a primary key column cannot be null (empty) because null values are not unique\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single or Composite\n",
    "- can consist of a single column or multiple columns, depending on the requirements of the database design\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Integrity\n",
    "- by enforcing uniqueness and non-null constraints, the primary key ensures that each record is uniquely identifiable, preventing data duplication and inconsistency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access and Referencing\n",
    "- primary keys are used to uniquely identify records within the table\n",
    "- they also serve as a basis for establishing relationships between tables using foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatically Generated Primary Keys\n",
    "- in some cases, primary key values are automatically generated by the DBMS when new records are added\n",
    "- this is often seen with auto-incrementing integer values\n",
    "\n",

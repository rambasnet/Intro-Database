    "# Relational Database Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- widely used type of database management system (DBMS) that organize data into tables with rows and columns\n",
    "- relational databases use the following concepts\n",
    "- deep understanding of these concepts help you mastering relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tables and Records\n",
    "\n",
    "- explanation of tables as the primary data storage units\n",
    "- understanding rows (also called records or tuples) as individual data entries in a table\n",
    "- columns (also called attributes or fields) as data characteristics stored in each record\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Customer Table with Records\n",
    "\n",
    "| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Email               |\n",
    "|------------|-----------|----------|---------------------|\n",
    "| 101        | John      | Doe      | john@example.com   |\n",
    "| 102        | Jane      | Smith    | jane@example.com   |\n",
    "| 103        | Michael   | Johnson  | michael@example.com|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary keys\n",
    "\n",
    "- definition of primary keys as unique identifiers for records within a table\n",
    "- importance of primary keys in maintaining data integrity and ensuring record uniqueness\n",
    "- illustration of primary key constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foreign Keys and Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- introduction to foreign keys as references to primary keys in other tables.\n",
    "- explanation of how foreign keys establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "- different types of relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints and Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "- discussion of various constraints, including unique constraints and not-null constraints\n",
    "- Explanation of how constraints ensure data validity and integrity\n",
    "- Role of constraints in preventing incorrect or incomplete data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "- introduction to normalization as a process for organizing data to minimize redundancy and data anomalies\n",
    "- explanation of normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.)\n",
    "- illustration of normalization through examples and practical scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Denormalization\n",
    "\n",
    "- understanding denormalization as the deliberate introduction of redundancy for performance optimization\n",
    "- when and why denormalization might be used in certain scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "- basic introduction to relational algebra, a set of mathematical operations used to manipulate relational data\n",
    "- operations like SELECT, PROJECT, JOIN, and UNION, and their practical implications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "- overview of ER modeling as a visual representation of data relationships\n",
    "- use of symbols like entities, attributes, and relationships in creating ER diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Database Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "- a schema refers to the logical and structural organization of a database\n",
    "- defines the layout, design, and relationships of the database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints\n",
    "- it provides a blueprint for how data is stored, how it is organized, and how different parts of the database are interconnected\n",
    "\n",
    "### Databae Schema: E-Commerce System\n",
    "\n",
    "- let's consider a simple example of a database schema for an e-commerce platform that tracks products, customers, and orders\n",
    "- this schema will define the structure and relationships between tables\n",

    "# MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://www.mongodb.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "- popular open-source NoSQL (non-relational) database management system designed for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data\n",
    "- often used in modern web and mobile applications, as well as in various other data-intensive use cases\n",
    "    - including content management systems, e-commerce platforms, real-time analytics, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications. Its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use make it a popular choice for developers working with diverse and evolving data requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here are some key characteristics and features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document-Oriented\n",
    "\n",
    "- MongoDB stores data in a format called BSON (Binary JSON), which is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents\n",
    "- these documents can have flexible and varying structures, making it suitable for handling data with changing schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schema-less\n",
    "\n",
    "- MongoDB is schema-less, which means that you can insert data without defining a rigid schema beforehand\n",
    "- this flexibility makes it well-suited for projects where data structures evolve over time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "- MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, making it capable of handling large amounts of data and high levels of traffic\n",
    "- It can be used in clusters to distribute data across multiple servers for load balancing and fault tolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rich Query Language\n",
    "- MongoDB provides a powerful query language for querying and retrieving data\n",
    "- You can perform complex queries, including filtering, sorting, and aggregation, using the MongoDB Query Language (MQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "- MongoDB supports the creation of indexes on fields in your documents, which can significantly improve query performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geospatial Capabilities\n",
    "- MongoDB includes geospatial features, allowing you to perform geospatial queries and store and analyze location-based data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replication and High Availability\n",
    "- MongoDB supports replica sets, which are groups of MongoDB servers that maintain identical copies of data \n",
    "- this provides data redundancy and high availability in case of server failures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sharding\n",
    "- MongoDB allows data to be distributed across multiple servers or shards, which can improve performance and scalability even further\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## MongoDB Document\n",
    "\n",
    "- records in MongoDB are called documents\n",
    "- has structure similar to JSON called BSON (Binary JSON)\n",
    "- e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "\ttitle: \"Post Title 1\",\n",
    "\tbody: \"Body of post.\",\n",
    "\tcategory: \"News\",\n",
    "\tlikes: 1,\n",
    "\ttags: [\"news\", \"events\"],\n",
    "\tdate: Date()\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- keys are strings without quotes, and the field values may include numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, or even nested documents\n",
    "\n",
    "## MongoDB Server\n",
    "\n",
    "- can download and install free community edition or use cloub-based Atlas\n",
    "- we'll utilize cloud-based free edition of MongoDB server\n",
    "- use Python PyMongo database driver - [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/)\n",
    "- install pymongo using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install pymongo\n",
    "$ python -m pip install pymongo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create your free account or signup using GitHub or Google\n",
    "- [https://account.mongodb.com/account/login](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "- let's call it intro-db\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create New Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- let's call it demo-db\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pick FREE deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a db user\n",
    "\n",
    "- give a name such as db-user\n",
    "- use Certificate for authentication\n",
    "- set certificate expiration - 6 months\n",
    "- save the certificate in your system\n",
    "- add your current IP address in list\n",
    "- load sample data\n",
    "\n",

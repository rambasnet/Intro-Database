    "# Database Index\n",
    "\n",
    "- An index in a database is a data structure that enhances the speed of data retrieval operations on a table\n",
    "- provides a way to quickly look up records based on the values in one or more columns\n",
    "- indexes are used to optimize query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned when searching for specific information\n",
    "- instead of scanning the entire table, the database engine can use the index to locate the relevant rows efficiently\n",
    "- work similar to the way an index works in a book\n",
    "- the index in a book lists keywords along with the page numbers where those keywords can be found\n",
    "- a database index contains values from one or more columns along with pointers to the corresponding rows in the table\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key points about database indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Faster Data Retrieval**: \n",
    "- indexes allow the database to avoid full-table scans and jump directly to the relevant data\n",
    "- significantly speeds up query execution for frequently searched columns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **B-Tree Structure**:\n",
    "- most database systems use a B-Tree (balanced tree) structure to store indexes efficiently\n",
    "- this structure ensures that index lookups have a logarithmic time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Column Selection**:\n",
    "- you can create indexes on one or multiple columns in a table\n",
    "- the choice of which columns to index depends on the queries you frequently run\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trade-Offs**: \n",
    "- while indexes improve read performance, they can slow down write operations (such as inserts, updates, and deletes) because the index needs to be updated whenever the data changes\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Maintenance**: \n",
    "- indexes need to be maintained as data changes\n",
    "- this adds overhead during data modification operations\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Unique Index**: \n",
    "- a unique index enforces the uniqueness of values in a column\n",
    "- tt's commonly used for primary key columns\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Composite Index**:\n",
    "- an index that spans multiple columns\n",
    "- it's useful when queries involve multiple columns together\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Covering Index**:\n",
    "- an index that includes all the columns required to satisfy a query, allowing the query to be executed solely using the index without accessing the actual table\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Clustered vs. Non-Clustered**:\n",
    "- some database systems differentiate between clustered and non-clustered indexes\n",
    "- A clustered index determines the physical order of data in the table, while a non-clustered index is a separate structure pointing to the data\n",
    "\n"

    "\n",
    "- https://sqlite.org/lang_createindex.html\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column1_name, column2_name, ...);\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",

    "- uniqe indexes are contraints that prevent duplicate values in the index column(s)\n",
    "- similar to UNIQE constraint on column\n",
